**KaTeX Playground** is an interactive web application that allows you to quickly experiment with [KaTeX](https://katex.org/). With this playground, you can instantly preview the rendered math expressions and even save and manage your work for future reference. Share your work with others via URI.

## Features

- **Real-time Rendering**: Write KaTeX and the rendered math expressions will appear immediately.
- **Local Storage**: Save your KaTeX expressions to your local storage, so you can copy and use them later.
- **Shareable URIs**: Generate a URI that encodes your KaTeX expressions, so you can share them with others.
